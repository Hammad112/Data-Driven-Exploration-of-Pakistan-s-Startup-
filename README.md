## Introduction

This repository contains resources for performing a data-driven exploration of the startup ecosystem in Pakistan. The analysis includes:

- Cleaning raw startup data.
- Preparing the data for analysis.
- Creating pivot tables to summarize key metrics.
- Visualizing the results using Excel.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset. This ensures that the data is accurate and ready for analysis.

### Steps in Excel

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Use `Data > Remove Duplicates`.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Use `Find & Select > Go To Special > Blanks` to locate and fill missing values.
3. **Correct Inconsistencies**: Standardize data entries using `Find & Replace` and data validation techniques.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation includes transforming variables, creating new features, and structuring the data to facilitate meaningful analysis. This step ensures that the data is in a format suitable for creating pivot tables and visualizations.

### Steps in Excel

1. **Date Formatting**: Ensure date fields are in the correct format using `Data > Text to Columns` or date functions.
2. **Categorical Encoding**: Use `Data Validation` and lookup tables to standardize categorical variables.
3. **Creating New Features**: Generate new columns using formulas like `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, and `VLOOKUP()`.

## Pivot Table

Pivot tables are used to summarize and analyze data by aggregating information across various dimensions, such as funding by year or the number of startups by category. This allows for a comprehensive view of the startup ecosystem.

### Steps in Excel

1. **Insert Pivot Table**: Select your data range and go to `Insert > PivotTable`.
2. **Rows and Columns**: Drag fields such as 'Year' to rows and 'Category' to columns.
3. **Values**: Drag numerical fields like 'Funding Amount' to values and select appropriate aggregation (e.g., sum, average).

## Excel Visualization

Excel is used to create dynamic and interactive visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. These visualizations help in interpreting and communicating the results of the analysis effectively.

### Steps in Excel

1. **Insert Chart**: Select the data you want to visualize and go to `Insert > Chart`.
2. **Customize Chart**: Add titles, labels, and adjust the color scheme to improve readability.
3. **Dynamic Charts**: Use slicers and interactive elements to create dynamic charts that allow for filtering and drill-down analysis.
